# DSA_Challenge_1_Video_Ciphering_Algorithm

### Tech Stack Used :

Python, DSA, Tkinter, cryptography

On running python ```Video_Ciphering_Algorithm.py``` this command a dialog box window appears on to the screen to browse the input file location.

while executing encryption/decryption, if we choose create new file after encryption/decryption the new files will be automatically store in assets folder as encrypted file encrypted folder and decrypted file decrypted folder.In case, if we select update existing file option no new file will be created existing itself become encrypted/decrypted.

### Folder Struture :

##### Note : if you want to transform existing file into encryption then choose **'n'** as option
### Decrption Execution with New File Creation :

### Encrypted File Looks like this :

### Decrypted File is same as Original File :
